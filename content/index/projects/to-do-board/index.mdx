During the pandemic, I spent a lot of hours on facetime with friends studying and working.
The idea came to mind to create a <span className="highlighted-sm">simple board</span> to keep track of each other's progress.
Now, to-do board can be used in many different ways and the best part is that it's <span className="highlighted-sm">free to use</span> and <span className="highlighted-sm">there is no sign up</span> required.
