I started a podcast and wanted to build a website for it. So I build a website where people can listen to our podcasts and learn more about us. In addition, I wanted to build an <span className="highlighted">interactive playground</span> for fun ideas we would have for listeners like <span className="highlighted">question forums</span> and <span className="highlighted">idea boards</span>.
